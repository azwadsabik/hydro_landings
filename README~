Hi Rodolfo, 

To make this work... 
1) place this entire hydro_landings folder to your ~/catkin_ws/src/ folder; run a catkin_make 
2) from hydro_landings/models, move ground_fiducials folder to ~/.gazebo/models (it's a hidden folder, so you may need to do View -> Show Hidden Files or just ctrl-h or command-h in your file explorer)
3) the following, in the relevant terminals:
- roscore
- rosrun joy joy_node
- rosrun ardrone_joystick ardrone_teleop
- roslaunch hydro_landings test.launch
- roslaunch hydro_landings markers.launch
